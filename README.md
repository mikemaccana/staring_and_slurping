# Staring and Slurping

## Start/stop Soundcloud using the F5 key on your Mac.

Originally I wanted Mac media key support, but there's no support for this at present inside Chrome. F5 is close though.

This is a first release - you currently need to be in Soundcloud for the extension to work. Next release will work across tabs, so you can start/stop Soundcloud from anywhere in Chrome.
